# ðŸ“Š GramFlwrs
 
#### GramFlwrs is an analytics tool that I've built to track my app's Instagram account. I've built it using SwiftUI and MVVM pattern to implement app's business logic. The app is highly responsive and packs a lot of animations. While developing this project I have also learned the Widget Extensions which I have also implemented to have a quick access to the data.
#### I have written an article that explains step-by-step how to implement a bar chart that I've developed for this project. You can find the tutorial [HERE](https://medium.com/@aisultan.askarov/revolutionize-your-ios-apps-data-display-with-this-custom-bar-chart-implementation-in-swiftui-bfe83506d85b)
